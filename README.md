# Project 2C code 

## Scientific Question: Can the structure of the hydrolyses in the egg whites of turtles, chickens, and turkeys, show the effects of evolution? 
## Hypothesis: If there is a conserved region in their protein sequence, then the protein structure of the hydrolase in the egg whites of turtles, chickens, and turkeys shows the effects of evolution.

In this repository, you need the following files to run the code upload:
- final_seq.txt - raw nucleotide sequence files of all the WNT genes of turtles, chickens, and turkeys
- protein_seq.txt - raw protein sequence files of all the hydrolase genes of turtles, chickens, and turkeys
- 2gv0.pdb - protein structure of Pelodiscus sinensis (soft-shelled turtle) egg white lysozyme
- 2zpo.pdb - protein structure of Chelonia mydas (green turtle) egg white lysozyme
- 6lyz.pdb - protein structure of Gallus gallus (hen) egg white lysozyme
- 1tew.pdb - protein structure of Meleagris gallopavo (turkey) egg white lysozyme
